    	<p class ="gray">is a true visionary. A few years ago, most of her neighbors in San Juan de la Laguna worked in the unstable economic climate of harvesting coffee, living off less than $2 a day. Ana knew hope was possible, and was determined to find a solution.</p>

        <h5>The backstrap loom is one of the great prides of the Tzutujil people.</h5>
        <p>Its simple technology means that almost anyone can own a backstrap loom and that the loom can be set up almost anywhere. This mobility allows the weaver to work indoors or outside, at a neighbor's house or in the marketplace, while keeping watch over the children or while chatting with friends.</p>
